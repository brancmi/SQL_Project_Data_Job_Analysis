### **Introduction**

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles. 
This project is a exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics and is part of the Luke Barousse’s SQL Course.

### **Background** 

The data for this analysis is from Luke Barousse’s SQL Course (https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

The questions I wanted to answer through the SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?

### Tools I Used

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.

### **What I Learned**

Throughout this project, I honed several key SQL techniques and skills:

- **Complex Query Construction**: Learning to build advanced SQL queries that combine multiple tables and employ functions like **`WITH`** clauses for temporary tables.
- **Data Aggregation**: Utilizing **`GROUP BY`** and aggregate functions like **`COUNT()`** and **`AVG()`** to summarize data effectively.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Developing the ability to translate real-world questions into actionable SQL queries that got insightful answers.

### **Insights**

From the analysis, several general insights emerged:

1. **Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs**: The highest-paying jobs for data analysts that allow remote work offer a wide range of salaries, the highest at $650,000!
2. **Skills for Top-Paying Jobs**: High-paying data analyst jobs require advanced proficiency in SQL, suggesting it’s a critical skill for earning a top salary.
3. **Most In-Demand Skills**: SQL is also the most demanded skill in the data analyst job market, thus making it essential for job seekers.
4. **Skills with Higher Salaries**: Specialized skills, such as SVN and Solidity, are associated with the highest average salaries, indicating a premium on niche expertise.
5. **Optimal Skills for Job Market Value**: SQL leads in demand and offers for a high average salary, positioning it as one of the most optimal skills for data analysts to learn to maximize their market value.

### **Conclusion**

This project enhanced my SQL skills and provided valuable insights into the data analyst job market.
